"""Asset-page read rules: what a browser may ask for, and what may be shown back.

This module is the single owner of the asset page's non-transport rules. It knows nothing about
HTTP, sessions, CSRF, aiohttp or the console: it takes one already-authenticated page request as a
plain mapping, normalizes it into the peer's own published read body, validates the peer's answer,
and projects that answer into the browser's redacted shape. The route adapter
(`services.platform.web_assets`) calls it; nothing calls back the other way.

Rules that live only here:

* the operation whitelist is exactly the five published reads, and no other name is forwarded;
* every identifier, query, path, page size and sorting option is bounded and validated;
* a continuation belongs to the connection, library, scope, query and sorting that produced it,
  so a cursor can never be replayed onto a different listing;
* a relative path is only ever relative: no root, drive letter, traversal or control character;
* the peer's answer must agree with what was asked for (same library, same entry, a hit that
  belongs to the library it names), otherwise it is an invalid upstream answer, not a page;
* a peer code this product does not own becomes one honest `upstream_error`.

Everything here is pure: no clock, no network, no store, no global state. That is what makes the
rules directly testable without a server, and it is why the adapter can stay about transport.
