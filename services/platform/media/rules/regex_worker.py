"""Regex worker: the only process that ever compiles or runs a user-supplied expression.

This file is started by :mod:`services.platform.media.rules.regex_process` as
``sys.executable -I -u <absolute path to this file>``. It is deliberately the smallest possible
program:

* it imports the standard library only (``json``, ``os``, ``re``, ``sys``) — no platform
  configuration, no server package, no network client, no filesystem access, no clock;
* it speaks one JSON object per line on stdin/stdout, in **UTF-8 on both directions**, never in the
  host's locale encoding: the parent writes UTF-8 bytes and the child decodes them as UTF-8, so a CJK
  or emoji pattern means the same thing on every host. ``PYTHONUTF8``/``PYTHONIOENCODING`` are not
  relied on: the child is started with ``-I``, which ignores them;
* it never writes source text anywhere else;
* its only secrets are the ones handed to it on that pipe, and it holds no compiled pattern after a
  ``forget`` command.

The hard budgets (3 s handshake, 50 ms per call, 5 s per request) belong to the parent, which kills
this process when one of them expires: ``re`` cannot be interrupted from inside, so the parent's
``terminate``/``kill`` *is* the timeout mechanism.

Protocol (one response line per request line, ``seq`` echoed verbatim):

* ``{"seq": N, "op": "compile", "pattern": P, "flags": F}`` →
  ``{"seq": N, "ok": true, "handle": N}`` or ``{"seq": N, "ok": false, "code": "invalid_regex"}``
* ``{"seq": N, "op": "search", "handle": H, "text": T}`` →
  ``{"seq": N, "ok": true, "matched": bool}`` or ``{"seq": N, "ok": false, "code": "unknown_handle"}``
* ``{"seq": N, "op": "forget", "handle": H}`` → ``{"seq": N, "ok": true}``

A malformed line is refused with ``{"seq": null, "ok": false, "code": "invalid_request"}`` and never
echoes its content. Closing stdin ends the loop and the process exits 0.

    that is not UTF-8 is a broken peer, not text to be repaired, and ``surrogateescape`` would put
    unencodable lone surrogates into a compiled pattern.
