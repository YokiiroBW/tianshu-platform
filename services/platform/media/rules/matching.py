"""Field projection and ordinary-text matching: what a rule actually sees.

The projection is the whole contract between normalized metadata and a rule, and it exists so that
no rule, and no future caller, can invent its own idea of "the title":

* ``title`` and ``description`` read **original** values. A manual display override changes what a
  media server shows; it must not change whether a subscription downloads the upload;
* ``uploader_id`` and ``uploader_name`` only read creators whose role is ``uploader``. A
  collaborator is a person, not the source of the upload, so their nickname cannot satisfy an
  "UP主" rule;
* an all-blank source string is a recorded gap, not an empty value: it projects to *no* values, and
  a field with no values does not match anything — not even ``regex=.*``;
* the per-field byte budget is checked before any unbounded copy is made, and an over-budget field
  is refused instead of truncated: cutting source text would change the truth of a rule.

Length is measured in UTF-8 bytes because that is what the IPC line carries; a 64 KiB CJK title is
therefore refused well before the transport limit, and the refusal stays a named ``input_too_large``.
